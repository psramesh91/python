#The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 385
#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 3025
#Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640
#Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers and the square of the sum.
